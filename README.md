This is a tiny project to recreate a game I created during my college studies. My final Java test required me to create a game. I chose to rebuild this game utilizing web technologies and the Vue JS Framework with Pinia state management.

## HOW TO PLAY
This game only works with laptops and desktop computers not phone ready.
The keyboard keys to move the heroe play is the up, down, left, and right keys.
For the heroe player to shoot use the spacebar key.

## Purpose
This game was built using Vue 3 framework and Pinia state management. This is game is to show how state management libraries are important.
This gives you a basis of what one can do with web applications. This is more experimental basis and learning more with Vue JS.

## Game Link
This game is still work in progress. I used netlify to deploy the web game the purpose of showing casing my work.
